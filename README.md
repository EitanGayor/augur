# TaintAnalysis

A general dynamic taint analysis for JavaScript, implemented using
[NodeProf](https://github.com/Haiyang-Sun/nodeprof.js).

# Implementations

There are two different implementations of the analysis: 
- [TypeScript](ts/): in the `ts` directory, being actively developed.
- [Java](java/): in the `java` directory, *not* being actively developed.

# Testing

[Unit tests](tests-unit/) (located in the `tests-unit` directory) are shared 
between implementations.
