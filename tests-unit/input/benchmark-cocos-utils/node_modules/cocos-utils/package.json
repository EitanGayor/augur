  "readme": "cocos-utils\n===========\n\n`cocos-utils` is a tool to support NPM branch of Cocos2d-html5 only, aims to help developers using cocos2d-html5 easily.\n\n[中文详细说明](https://github.com/SmallAiTT/cocos-utils/wiki/cocos-utils-%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%E8%AF%A6%E7%BB%86%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E)\n\n## Installing\n* Install `nodejs`...\n* Install `ant`...\n\nThe function `cocos publish` requires `ant`, if you don't want to use `cocos publish`, you don't need to install `ant`.\n\n* Then type:\n\n```bash\nnpm install cocos-utils -g\n```\n\nYou know, it may take a long time to install modules from npm in China, because there is a \"Wall\".\nIn this case, you can try this:\n\n```bash\nnpm --registry \"http://registry.cnpmjs.org\" install cocos-utils -g\n```\n\nAnd when using `cocos install` and `cocos update`, you may need to add an option, such as `cocos install -r`, \nor `cocos install -r \"http://registry.cnpmjs.org\"`. The `-r` option default to be `http://registry.cnpmjs.org`.\n\n\nSometimes, you should type `sudo npm install ...` in mac or lunix, \nbecause `npm` requires administrator permissions.\n\nType `cocos help` to check whether the installing is successful.\n\n\n\n## HelloWorld\n\n##### Install all modules of cocos2d-html5\n\n```bash\ncd your/workspace/\ncocos install\n```\n\nSometimes, you should type `sudo cocos install` in mac or lunix, \nbecause `cocos install` calls `npm install`, and `npm` requires administrator permissions.\n\nSometimes, you may need to use `cocos install -r` if you are in China.\n\n##### Create project of cocos2d-html5\n\n(under your workspace)\n\n```bash\ncocos new helloworld\ncd helloworld\ncocos build\n```\n\n##### Visit dev version\nBe sure that your project and modules of cocos2d-html5 have been published in a webServer, \nthen visit `http://serverhost:port/your/project/path/index.html` in your browser. \n\nPay attention to this, modules of cocos2d-html5 should also been published in the webServer.\n\nOpen it with FireFox if you have not published them in a webServer.\n\n##### Publishing\n\n(under helloworld)\n\n```bash\ncocos publish\n```\n\n##### Visit release version\nBe sure that your project has been published in a webServer, \nthen visit `http://serverhost:port/your/project/path/release.html` in your browser. \n\nOpen it with FireFox if you have not published them in a webServer.\n\n## Structure of project\n\n```script\n- node_modules (dir of engine modules)\n    -cocos2d-html5 (core for engine)\n\n- helloworld (project dir)\n    - cfg\n        - res.js (Config of path of resources, generated by cocos genRes)\n        - jsRes.js (Config of path of js sources, generated by cocos genRes)\n        - resCfg.js (Config of dependencies for all resources)\n\n    - res (Path of resources)\n        - Normal (Normal version)\n        - HD (HD version)\n        - Audio\n\n    - src (Dir to put sources)\n    - test  (Dir to put test sources)\n\n    - node_modules (dir of third party modules)\n\n    - cocos2d.js (Boot config of game)\n    - main.js (Main for game)\n    - baseCfg.js (Base config for game to load js and so on)\n    - index.html (Url of dev version)\n\n    - mini.js (Generated by cocos publish)\n    - build.xml (Generated by cocos publish, used for closer compiler)\n    - release.html (Url of release version)\n\n    - cocos.json (Config for cocos command)\n\n    - package.json\n```\n\n\n\n## Files generated by the utils.\n\nThere are files generated by the utils, which you should not edit by yourself. Because they may be overwrited while running `cocos` command again.\n\n* files in __temp\n* res.js\n* jsRes.js\n* baseCfg.js\n* build.xml (after publishing)\n* mini.js (after publish)\n* sourcemap (after publish)\n\n\n## cocos.json\nThis file is about config of `cocos` command.\nIf there is something wrong while using `cocos` command, check this file first.\n\n[Click here to see more details](https://github.com/SmallAiTT/cocos-utils/wiki/cocos.json).\n\n\n## resCfg\nThis is the main config for the dependencies of the project.\nIt is the core to load js and resources, just like what `resources.js` and `appFiles` of `cocos2d.js` do in the develop branch.\n`cc.js` takes place of `jsLoader.js`, so `jsLoader` do not work in this npm branch.\n\n[Click here to see more details](https://github.com/SmallAiTT/cocos-utils/wiki/resCfg).\n\n\n## package.json\nSame as `package.json` of `npm`.\n\nThird party modules will be configured in `dependencies`.\nIf you add or delete a module (dependencies in package.json or cocos.json),\nyou should run `cocos build` or `cocos genBaseCfg` once more.\n\n\n## Unit Test\nBy default, we have provided some test functions for you.\nAlso you can define your own test functions.\n\n[Click here to see more details](https://github.com/SmallAiTT/cocos-utils/wiki/Unit-Test).\n\n## Notes\nDo not forget run `cocos genRes` if you add or delete resources, rename the resources or change the paths of the resources.\n\nDo not forget run `cocos genJsRes` if you add or delete js, rename js or change the path of js.\n\nDo not forget run `cocos genBaseCfg` if you install or uninstall modules of cocos2d-html5 which are configured in dependencies of cocos.json,\nor of third party which are configured in dependencies of package.json.\n\nIn fact, you can use `cocos build` which includes these three command above.\n\n\nBe sure that each key in your `res.js` and `jsRes.js` is unique, which is generated by the file name. The rule of key is :\n\n```script\na.png  :  a_png        //\".\" will be replaced by \"_\"\na-b.png  :  a_b_png    //\"-\" will be replaced by \"_\"\n1a.png  :  _1a_png     //\"_\" will be add before if the first char is a number\na b.png  :  ab.png     //\" \" will be replaced by \"\"\n```\n\n`cc.js` will be replaced with `cc4publish.js` when publishing.\n\nThere are test cases in each modules of cocos2d-html5, which is quite different from the develop branch.\nThe code is clearer and smaller for developers. \nAnd I think it is a better way for developers to learn cocos2d-html5.\nKeep all modules of cocos2d-html5 in the same folder, boot your web server, then visit it(`index.html` in each module).\n",
